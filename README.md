## Setting up a virtual environment locally
Since we won't be pushing our virtual environments to github (excluded through my gitignore), I can create one locally by following a set of steps that reads from the requirements.txt. 
If i use more libraries or packages that aren't already in the requirements.txt, navigate to the top level directory, and then I can use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` ??
